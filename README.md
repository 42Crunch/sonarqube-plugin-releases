# SonarQube Plugin: 42Crunch REST API Static Security Testing

The plugin is powered by 42Crunch [API Contract Security Audit](https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/concepts/api_contract_security_audit.htm). Security Audit performs a static analysis of the API definition that includes more than 200 checks on best practices and potential vulnerabilities on how the API defines authentication, authorization, transport, and data coming in and going out. For more details on the checks, see [API Security Encyclopedia](https://apisecurity.io/encyclopedia/content/api-security-encyclopedia.htm).

API contracts must follow the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) (formely Swagger). Both OAS v2 and v3, and both JSON and YAML formats are supported.
